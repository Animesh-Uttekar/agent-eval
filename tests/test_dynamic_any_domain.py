Test the Dynamic Framework with DIFFERENT domains (not finance)

This demonstrates that the framework can automatically:
1. Analyze ANY AI agent in ANY domain
2. Generate custom metrics for that specific agent
3. Generate custom judges with domain expertise  
4. Create custom test scenarios
5. Provide domain-specific evaluation

Examples: Education AI, Healthcare AI, Creative Writing AI, Customer Service AI

    Great question about photosynthesis! Let me explain this in a way that's easy to understand.
    
    Think of a plant like a tiny food factory! Here's how it works:
    
    THE RECIPE FOR PLANT FOOD:
    Ingredients needed:
    - Sunlight (the energy source)
    - Water (from the roots)
    - Carbon dioxide (from the air through leaves)
    - Chloroplasts (the tiny green "machines" in leaves)
    
    THE PROCESS:
    1. The plant "catches" sunlight with its green leaves
    2. Water travels up from the roots like drinking through a straw
    3. Leaves breathe in carbon dioxide from the air
    4. The green parts (chloroplasts) mix everything together
    5. RESULT: The plant makes glucose (sugar) for food + releases oxygen for us to breathe!
    
    COOL FACT: This is why we need plants - they give us the oxygen we breathe!
    
    QUICK CHECK: Can you tell me what the plant uses from the sun? 
    And what does it give back to us? This helps me know you understand!

    Here's a compelling opening for your mystery novel:
    
    "The coffee shop smelled wrong.
    
    Detective Sarah Chen paused in the doorway, her instincts screaming despite the ordinary scene before her‚Äîcustomers typing on laptops, the barista wiping down counters, soft jazz playing overhead. But underneath the aroma of fresh espresso lurked something else. Something metallic.
    
    She'd learned to trust her nose after twelve years on the force. It had never lied to her.
    
    The call had been routine: wellness check on Marcus Webb, the owner who hadn't opened yesterday. Neighbors worried. But now, scanning the too-perfect normalcy of the caf√©, Sarah's hand drifted toward her holster.
    
    'Can I help you?' The barista's smile was bright. Too bright.
    
    'Police. Looking for Marcus Webb.'
    
    'Oh, he's in the back office. Been there all morning.' The smile never wavered. 'Very focused on... paperwork.'"
    
    CREATIVE ANALYSIS:
    This opening uses several effective techniques:
    - Sensory details (smell) to create unease
    - Experienced protagonist with established skills
    - Contrast between ordinary surface and underlying tension  
    - Dialogue that hints at deception
    - Strong hook that compels reading forward
    
    For your next scene, consider escalating the tension by having Sarah investigate further while maintaining the psychological cat-and-mouse dynamic.
